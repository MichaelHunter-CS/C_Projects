    Program description:
    This program is to serve the purpose of checking whether a year is a leap year or not based on the Gregorian calendar.
    The user simply enters a year of their choosing and based on the Gregorian calendar one of two things will occur:
    1) The year the user entered is indeed a leap year
    2) The year the user entered is not a leap year

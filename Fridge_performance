    Program description:
    The user's refridgerator is broken.
    A repair person arrives and they measure the temperature of the room and fridge but is unable to convert the measurements into Fahrenheit or Celsius depending on where you are located.
    This program the serves as a measurement convertor for the repair job. 
    The user firstly chooses which temperature they are looking for.
    The user the enters the temperature of the fridge followed by the temperature of the room.
    The program then returns the temperature in the chosen measurement.
